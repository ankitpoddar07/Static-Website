        <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; 01.WHAT IS PYTHON & HISTORY OF PYTHON ?</h3>
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            <b>Python</b> is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and
            analyze data. Python is a general-purpose language, not specialized for any specific problems, and used to
            create various programmes. This versatility and its beginner-friendliness have made it one of the most used
            programming languages today.<br>
            * In 2020, more than one-third of Indian IT professionals said Python was their
            preferred programming language [2]. It continues to top lists of the most desired programming languages in
            the country.<br><br>
            <b>* Did you know ?</b> <br><br>
            ->The name Python comes from Monty Python. When Guido van Rossum was creating
            Python, he was also reading the scripts from BBC's Monty Python's Flying Circus. He thought the name Python
            was appropriately short and slightly mysterious.<br><br>
            <b>* Python is commonly used for developing :-></b><br>
            -> websites and software,<br>  ->task automation,<br> ->data analysis, and<br>  ->data
            visualisation.<br><br>
            <b>* Since</b> it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as
            accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances.

            "Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity," says University of Michigan and Coursera
            instructor Charles R Severance in his book Python for Everybody. "You can write programs for many reasons,
            ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping
            someone else solve a problem."<br>

            <br><b># What can you do with Python? Some things include :-></b><br><br>

            -> Data analysis and machine learning<br>

            ->Web development<br>

            ->Automation or scripting<br>

            ->Software testing and prototyping<br>

            ->Everyday tasks<br>

           <b> Python</b> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
            readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It
            supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.<br><br>
